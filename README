An ANSI implementation of the TGFSR(twisted generalized
feedback shift register) random number generator TT800

This is a single file implementation, should be easy to embed into any project

Published in Matsumoto, M. and Kurita, Y.: Twisted GFSR generators II.
  ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulations,
  Vol 4, No. 3, July 1994, pp 254--266

The generator produces a pseudo-random sequence of 32 bit integers
  with period 2^800 - 1 and is reported to have excellent
  equidistribution properties, as well as being fast.
